# CSCI455-TCPServer
Multithreaded TCP Server/Client
To run this program simply run the TCPServer file to start up the server. Next, run the ClientMain file to start a new client. ClientMain can be ran in as many instances as you like. Send messages to the server via the client console. Enter "exit" when ready to quit in that client.
